# OOPs ( Day 1 )

## Size Of Class & Object:

```txt
Class does not have any size or space.
Memory is required only when object is created.
```

```txt
In this following example, size of h1 object will be 8 byte because only int health & char level is present in class that require memory size of 5.
Then what about another 5 bytes 
```

`ðŸ‘‰ Homework :- Read padding & greedy alignment`

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Hero {
    
    // properties or data member
    int health;
    char level;
};

int main() {
    
    Hero h1;
    
    cout<<sizeof(h1)<<endl;  

	
    return 0;
}
```

### For Empty Class Case

```txt
In case of empty class , object will have size of 1 byte for the identification or to track.
```
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Hero {
    
    // properties or data member

};

int main() {
    
    Hero h1;
    
    cout<<sizeof(h1)<<endl;
    //  if case of empty class , object will have size of 1 byte for the identification or to track.

	
    return 0;
}
```
---

## Define Class In Other File And Import It In Another File

### Defining class in another file
```cpp
// Hero.cpp file name

class Hero {

  //properties
  char name[100];
  int health;
  char level;
};
```
### Import/Including class in main file

```cpp
// main.cpp

#include<iostream>
#include "Hero.cpp"
using namespace std;

int main(){
    
    // creation of object
    Hero ramesh;
    
    cout<<sizeof(h1)<<endl;
    //  if case of empty class , object will have size of 1 byte for the identification or to track.

	
    return 0;
}
```

## Accessing Data Members/Properties

Using dot (.) operator, but it can be accessed outside the class by only if data members are public.

```
Hero ramesh;

cout<<"health is : "<< ramesh.health << endl;
cout<<"level is : "<< ramesh.level << endl;
```
---

## Access Modifiers

### 1. Private (by default):
Private data member and methods can be accessible only inside the class itself.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Hero{
    
    char level;
public:
    int health;
    
    void printLevel() {
        cout<<"Level is : "<< level << endl;  // level data member is accessible only in class because it is private
    }
};


int main() {
    
    // creation of object
    Hero ramesh;
    
    cout<< "health is : "<< ramesh.health << endl;  // accessible
    
    cout<< "level is : "<< ramesh.level << endl;  // not accessible outside the class , throw error

	
    return 0;
}
```
### 2. Public:
Public data member and methods can be accessed outside the class means anywhere you can access them.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Hero{
    
    char level;
public:
    int health;
};


int main() {
    
    // creation of object
    Hero ramesh;
    
    cout<< "health is : "<< ramesh.health << endl;  // accessible
    
    cout<< "level is : "<< ramesh.level << endl;  // not accessible outside the class , throw error

	
    return 0;
}
```
### 3. Protected:

```cpp
```

## Set values of public data members

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Hero{
    
public:
    char level;
    int health;
    
    void printLevel() {
        cout<<"Level is : "<< level << endl;  
    }
};


int main() {
    
    // creation of object
    Hero ramesh;
    
    ramesh.health = 70;
    ramesh.level = 'A';
    
    cout<< "health is : "<< ramesh.health << endl;  
    
    cout<< "level is : "<< ramesh.level << endl;  

	
    return 0;
}
```

## Getter and Setter:

Because we can not directly access the private data mambers. 
That's why we access them using functions.

ðŸ‘‰ We can make condition who can access these private data members in functions using if-else

```cpp
  int getHealth() {
        if(health <= 70){
        return health;
        } else {
            return ;
        }
  }
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Hero{
    
private:
    int health;
public:
    char level;
    
    void printLevel() {
        cout<<"Level is : "<< level << endl;  
    }
    
    // getter of data members either if it is private or public
    int getHealth() {
        return health;
    }
    
    char getLevel() {
        return level;
    }
    
    // setter
    void setHealth(int h){
        health = h;
    }
    
    void setLevel(char l){
        level = l;
    }
};


int main() {
    
    // creation of object
    Hero ramesh;
    
    cout<< "Ramesh health is : "<< ramesh.getHealth() << endl;  
    
    // setting the health
    
    setHealth(89);
    
    cout<< "Ramesh health is : "<< ramesh.getHealth() << endl;

	
    return 0;
}
```

## Static vs Dynamic Allocation

### Static Allocation

In previous examples, we have allocate object statistically

```cpp
Hero ramesh;

//access
cout<< ramesh.level() << endl;
```

### Dynamic Allocation

```cpp
// previously study already
int *i = new int;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now dynamically object implementation
```cpp
Hero *ramesh = new Hero;

//access 

cout<< (*ramesh).level << endl;
cout<< ramesh->level <<endl;
```


## Constructor

Whenever we create a object then a constructor is called or invoke automatically behind the scene.
