# Choosing the Right Data Structure

## 🧠 Factors Influencing Data Structure Selection

### 1. 📊 Data Characteristics

* **Type, size, and nature** of data directly impact the structure choice.
* **Example:**

  * Use **arrays** for **fixed-size** data.
  * Use **linked lists** for **dynamic data** with frequent **insertions/deletions**.

### 2. ⚙️ Operations and Usage

* Identify **primary operations** (search, insert, delete, etc.).
* Evaluate **operation frequency** to pick structures optimized for common tasks.

### 3. 🧮 Memory and Storage Constraints

* Consider **available memory** and **storage limitations**.
* Use **memory-efficient structures** like:

  * **Bit arrays**
  * **Compressed representations**

### 4. 🔄 Access Patterns

* Understand whether access is **sequential**, **random**, or **specific**.
* **Examples:**

  * **Arrays** for **sequential** access
  * **Hash tables** for **random** key-based access

### 5. 🧩 Algorithmic Requirements

* Align structure with algorithms that will use it.
* **Examples:**

  * Use **adjacency lists** for **graph algorithms** to ease traversal.

## ✅ Common Data Structure Selection Scenarios

### 🔍 Search Operations

* **Array:** Linear or binary search
* **Hash Table:** Constant-time average case
* **Binary Search Tree:** Logarithmic time if balanced

### ➕ Insertion and ➖ Deletion

* **Arrays:** Costly due to shifting
* **Linked Lists:** Efficient at head/tail or using pointers

### 🔢 Ordered Data

* **Arrays:** Keep sorted, but insertions/deletions costly
* **Balanced Trees (AVL, Red-Black):** Maintain order with efficient operations

### 💾 Memory Efficiency

* Use compact structures like:

  * **Bit Arrays**
  * **Bloom Filters** (probabilistic, efficient space usage)

### 🚀 Frequent Access

* **Hash Tables:** Fast random access with keys
* **Self-Balancing Trees:** Maintain order with efficient lookup times
